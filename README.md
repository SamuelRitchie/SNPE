This repository contains an adaptation of the algorithm and Matlab implementation as described in "Nonlinear Panel Data Estimation via Quantile Regressions" (M. Arellano, S. Bonhomme) in order to study the impact of union membership on the wages by the approach described in their article. This project was done for the course "Semi & Non Parametric Econometrics", given by X. D'Haultfoeille @ENSAE ParisTech in Fall 2017.
