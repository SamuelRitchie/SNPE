This repository contains a description of the algorithm described in "Nonlinear Panel Data Estimation via Quantile Regressions" (M. Arellano, S. Bonhomme) at well as a fork (slightly modified) of their Matlab implementation in order to study the impact of union membership on the wages by the approach described in their article. This project was done for the course "Semi & Non Parametric Econometrics", given by X. D'Haultfoeille @ENSAE ParisTech in Fall 2017.
